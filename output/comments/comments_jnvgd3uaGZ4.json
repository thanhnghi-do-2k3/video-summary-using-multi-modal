  "Are bhai free wala hai toh bata mere bhai 😂",
  "Total garbage \nNo.freeee",
  "app is too expensive.",
  "I’ve used this for years before the price increase, has a few issues like objects disappearing into the walls, when you have saved projects with textured/graphics on walls and go back to your projects the graphics will pass through the walls, same with grass coming up into the houses floor or objects completely being invisible once placed. Also drowns a fully charged iPad in about 1-1/2 hrs of using this app. Also you use to receive a few photo edits renderings that you could take of you project in the app to send in and I never received the edits/renderings back. \nI do still like the app because it’s user friendly, I was interested in purchasing the pro version this year  but there are just too many unsolved issues/bugs that need fixed to make those new prices worth it.",
