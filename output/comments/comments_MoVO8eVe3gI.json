  "Beautiful, you and the design.",
  "That's really sweet, thanks! 💖",
  "Rachael could you explain us how to create the different interactive prototypes!?",
  "Just started exploring UI, and this was a great start! Any resources or a quick walkthrough on how you made that mobile demo at the end?",
  "working on making one video on this soon! :)",
  " @RachelHow  Awesome🙂🎉",
  "Great work on the design, how do you do the final animation that you showed?",
  "hi! first, create the app prototype in figma, and then record it using any screen recording tool. Once you have the video recording ready, import into Rotato (a paid software) and edit there. It should take less than an hour 🙏",
  "I love the series. I just wish the UX designs were not app only. Can we get examples of computer/desktop laptop problem solving for big screens? I find it fast and simple to design for mobile, but for desktop it feels like there is always \"Too much space\" and designs look \"empty\".",
  "thanks for the feedback, desktop can be tricky to squeeze all info in a short video but i’ll see what i can do 🤔",
  "Can you pls tell me how you made that short video at the end in the result section, as I have got to submit a pitching video for my app and that end video was just straight up brilliant 🔥",
