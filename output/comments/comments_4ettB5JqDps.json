  "Great video. If you need to migrate from a medium enterprise using Prime React. Do you think is a good option moved to MUI? or just growth using Prime React. what factors do you think I need to consider? I already checked the component I use vs the component MUI have but I want to analyze different approaches. Thanks in advanced",
  "If you're code is working with prime react, leave it alone because it's unnessary to migrate to mui. Don't make the migration to mui overhead  for yourself.",
  "Can not wait your Next.js Series !",
  "I'm currently working on it",
  "after i use shadcn,mantine,nextui(hero ui),mui\n- MUI very good component but styling component is completely frustated (my skill issue i know)\n- next ui (hero ui) like shadcn but pretty by default. and styling still easy but not easy as shadcn.\n- mantine. styling component is almost dificult (and dificult to consistent)but okay. and i love mantine hook. life is good with mantine XD\n- shadcn. i just love it. the easiest to customize. but i  have many issue with shadcn cmponent like bluring dropdown, etc.",
  "Thanks alot for sharing your amazing experience with usüôè. For prototyping and fast develop, mui is the choice for me. But if I have enough time for developing and customizing, shadcn as you mentioned is my first choice",
  "Are Bhai Hindi me nahi hai kya",
  "I love heroUI for its sleek micro interactions and styling.\nBut usually use shadcn because have to match with the provided design.",
  "Makes sense. You're always gonna have to choose the best fit for your project!"
