  "Dear Tubuguruji Team,\r\nYour work is nothing short of exceptional. The projects you create don’t just follow trends—they define them. The hands-on experience your academy provides is invaluable, and I, along with many others, truly appreciate it.That’s why I want to share two key improvements that could make an already amazing experience even better:\r\n1, Clerk Development Mode Restriction – Many of your projects currently run in development mode on Clerk, which limits access to the sign-up page. This small fix could unlock the full potential of your work for us.\r\n\r\n2, AI Personal Assistant Video Update – On the homepage, the project videos currently redirect to YouTube. Embedding them directly (or even replacing them with a more relevant video) would create a more seamless and immersive experience.\r\n\r\nThese aren’t just tweaks—they’re opportunities. Implementing them will make your already standout projects even more engaging, helping your academy grow and attract even more dedicated learners.Keep up the incredible work—what you’re building is making an impact, and we’re excited for what’s next!\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nA Proud Member of Your Academy",
