  "I became a Flutter fan the moment I started using it. I feel like it's simple and works great.",
  "Is it safe to just dive into learning flutter, as I see more jobs for full stack developers",
  "I know webdev (angular and react) but i also developed with kotlin with jetpack compose already and it was funny and cool for me. Are there some advantage of taking flutter over react native in this case like i dont know maybe better APIs for Device Functionality or faster development or something?\nI mean React Native != React so there will also be a learning curve so if flutter has some more advantage i could also learn it i plan in the near future (6 months) start a Marketing and Software agency so i look for the best solution",
  "Flutter had for a long time a better rendering engine, which offered a smoother experience ‚ú® but I read that React Native made good progress on that side as well. Since you already know Web Dev, and React Native is still in demand and very similar to Flutter, it's probably optimal to try React Native first, in my opinion.",
  "@ okay thanks then i will try react native",
  "¬†@bartekdurczak4085¬† Good luck ü§û",
  "Hi Dan, I have seen your presentation video it was indeed a great way of letting us know about the AI implementation in to the apps and that kills all the doubts we have. My question is which one is better whether iOS or android to move forward in the coming days in Native. As you said in one video Kotlin is using as Native, Backend, KMP using in native of iOS and Android and ReactNative(JS). For example I go with iOS I have to focus on completely Native iOS. If android I have to go with Kotlin and where KMP is similar to kotlin and it helps as cross platform. What would be the future demand ?",
  "Thanks for watching ‚ò∫ it's hard to say which one will thrive, they all should. With native iOS you're more in a close environment: ios, ipad, vision pro, it's exciting but you're limited to apple products (which are increasingly popular üìà). On the other hand, yes, Kotlin offers more versatility, so if you want to explore stuff (backend, KMP, Android), then it's probably better, but to make a career quickly and to make money, probably native iOS üòÖ the entry barrier is also higher than on Android.",
  "Hi, I want to develop a space repetition app with AI integration for both android and iOS devices, so what will be the best option for be me ? Please help‚Ä¶ I am a AI and ML engineer",
  "Hi, I'm not sure I understand, \"space repetition\"? ü§î in theory, the most accessible route would be with a TensorFlow model that you can use in both apps. Not sure if cross-platform would be good enough, based on your complexity, I need more details about the app.",
  "Awesome video, found you just in time. I want to build a mobile app (for fun and as a way to maybe have an additional income) and based on everything I read so far, I think it will be Flutter with Firebase in the backend. So will invest some time into learning Flutter. Do you also have experience with ASO and publishing an app and monetization process, paywalls etc? These are topics that are not very much covered on Youtube. I am a Romanian too, glad to learn from another Romanian. Your channel will grow quickly :)",
  "Saluut! ü§© So cool! Yes, after reading about why you want to start an app, Flutter + Firebase seems like a great choice. I do have some experience with ASO and monetization, but honestly not a lot. Some of the apps I worked on over the years (for clients, not my own apps) required me to dive into that (+ I talked to other devs). I'm happy to share some stuff about that, thanks for the idea üí° Looking forward to seeing your app! Btw, pe instagram postez mai des si mai raspund la DMs cand nu-s 50 pe zi :)) ‚úå",
  "Very good points that are well explained. Thanks man. Great video.",
  "Thank you so much! ü§© happy to hear that!",
  "ok i understand nothing prettty much after the half of the video",
  "Sorry to hear that, what's the biggest confusion? You can ask it here and I'm happy to help and respond üòä",
  "Nice Video! Flutter is more popular than ReactNative in Japan now.",
  "Thank you! üôè and thanks for the info, that's good to know, I don't personally know any developers in Japan, so I'm happy to connect, you can find my instagram here as well: https://www.instagram.com/dan.mobile.dev/",
  "I congratulate you on the quality of your videos. PLZ I would like to know if there is a real alternative to Firebase.",
  "In the next 5 years, Flutter's adoption is expected to grow even further, as it provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for both startups and enterprises. At the same time, Kotlin Multiplatform will also see growth, especially in cases where native-level performance is required."
