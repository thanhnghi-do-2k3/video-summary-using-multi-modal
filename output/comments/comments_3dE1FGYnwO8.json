  "Added to styles! Thnx!",
  "Should be height 4 Gutter 0 offset 0 is perfect\nif height 0 gutter 1 work area = 5",
  "I get uneven columns and spaces with this grid system",
  "I very much dislike videos like this because they say \"perfect grid\" but never say why that's the case. Never design something without knowing the reason why because you could run into some bad design habits.",
  "Thanks man",
  "The height of the row should be 4, not 1",
  "Thanks A lot🙏🙏",
  "malisimso",
  "Is this a 4pt grid system?",
  "Why is this important?",
  "Is there no explanation as to why these settings are used?",
  "Insightful!!🎉",
  "Unfortunately, this will leave you with uneven columns. A better grid would be 25 margins and 16 gutters (for the 390 frame). That leaves you with even columns of 73. Your problem is that 390 is not directly divisible by 8 or 4 if you want to be left with \"whole numbers\". Therefore you have to account for this by adding 1px to the margin.",
  "Even better…grab an android 360px L frame :-)",
  "What would be a good grid for 375*812? \nPlease help",
  " @pragyagupta7536  Depends on your design choices...i would probably just accept the uneven number (1px difference) here and design for 374 or 376 :-) E.g. 4 colum setup: margin 24, gutter 16 and 4 columns of 70 or margin 16, gutter 16 and 4 columns of 74. I would not design at 375 nowadays anyway...",
  " @RemcoBakker548  ok thank for letting me know, then in what dimensions would u prefer to style if not 375? And why not 375?",
  "Can you speak in plain English please",
  "Will this grid be responsive ?"
