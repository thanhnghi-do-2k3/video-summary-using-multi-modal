  "Curious to know the current revenue for this AI keyboard app that you bought",
  "I just binged watched all your episodes 😎",
  "Haha this is an app that I actually build last year and haven't launched (yet!, it still has some rough edges) :D good luck !",
  "Ahead of the game! Why not launch?",
  " @adamlyttleapps  I've built 10 apps in that time, decided to launch other one. Maybe that was a mistake?",
  "4:45 “it’s built into the iOS keyboard”? It’s a separate keyboard right? 🤔",
  "Yeah, keyboard plugin, meant it’s built into the keyboard area.",
  "@ ahh thanks for clarifying! Was hoping there was a way to build widgets/extensions for the native keyboard that I didn’t know about. If there was I’d jump straight in and build some language/translation tools 😎",
  "Thanks for sharing these insights Adam",
  "Very informative and full of great ideas! Thanks Adam",
  "I think you're exactly right that sometimes \"Sherlocking\" actually drives more traffic to third party apps. While I'd love to see Siri improvements, I'm expecting to be disappointed; Apple has let Siri languish for a decade and the first round of \"intelligence\" features are equally slapdash.",
  "Just released my first app today; Track My Mods ! Thanks for inspiring me across the development journey!! 😄😄",
  "Not sure I would be against Apple priority. Sure might be a win in the shortterm but hardly a viable business for many years.",
  "💯 not long term viable. Even if supporting older devices they will be phased out in coming years",
  "Very educative, I watched your interview with notjustdev, really great.",
  "Thanks mate!",
  "Oh, hello there",
  "If anyone is looking to buy solid AI keyboard app, please reach out I can sell mine :)",
  "🤔",
  "The thing is, that can change anytime with an update on the Apple side?"
