The goal here was to give a streamlined approach. As you learn things, you will naturally go on some tangents down different areas. That is not only okay, but actually encouraged as an important part of learning.\n2. Try not to feel overwhelmed by everything. Take it 1 step at a time, using 1-2 primary resources for each step.\n3. Note that you don‚Äôt necessarily need to learn everything in all of these steps, particularly the later ones. That said, I wanted to include it all for more completeness.\n4. I mention SEO and performance both as key benefits of SSR in the video. But I wanted to add that these topics are not necessarily linked to each other. Learning about both SEO and performance optimizations can be a great step towards improving your skills! Also, there‚Äôs plenty of other benefits to SSR.",
  "thanks so much for this video and all the resources included in this pinned comment",
  "Hey could you pin the comment with all the resources?",
  "@shreya6229¬† Weird, I'm pretty sure this was pinned at one point. Not sure how it got unpinned, but thanks for the heads up! Fixed now üëç",
  "no fixed ¬†@ConnerArdman¬†",
  "¬†@ConnerArdman¬† editing comment does that i think",
  "pin it please",
  "¬†@ConnerArdman¬† its unpinned again, just wanted to let you know",
  "Tak about the odin project bro",
  "Do you think AI will replace web developers?",
  "It could givee some help in code but can do full work",
  "You‚Äôre great bro keep that way",
  "Thank you so much!!!!!!",
  "Stack Overflow what is that nothing with such a name  exists in 2025",
  "Great roadmap, I'd add ontop of that learning computer architecture, data communication, operating systems, and algorithm analysis and design. The more senior developer or engineer you become, the more you're expected to know these topics in depth.",
  "Awesome video! Thanks!",
  "hii, thank you for the video. it really helped. what happen if I use java instead of node js for back end ?",
  "Should we go deeper in each section?",
  "thank you",
  "absolute gold"
