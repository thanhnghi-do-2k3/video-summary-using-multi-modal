  " @rezakarimnia9301  Such individual guidance I offer in the Campus :)\nhttps://pl-coding.com/campus",
  "compose multiplatform > native android",
  "give tutrial for android automotive os",
  "In 2025? Absolutely not. Very few jobs.",
  "In short, don't start your career as an  android developer \" go for javascript or java tech stack\"\nI have not seen this video but yes he is selling android courses and \ngoogle android tech stack keeps on changing every 6 months will not help you in long run with more experience\nI am telling after 8 years of experience in android development",
  "Hello Philipp,\n\nThank you for your valuable advice! I need your help.\n\nI’m passionate about Android development and have been learning it since 2021. I followed your 2024 roadmap, plus Firebase, and continue to learn more. I’ve worked with Java, Kotlin, XML, and Jetpack Compose, and I have three published apps.\n\nI also have an idea for an app that could be highly popular but requires a significant budget. Right now, I need a job to support myself and fund this project, but I’ve been struggling to find one—most companies say I’m not a good fit.\n\nAfter dedicating almost four years to it, I don’t want to give up on Android development, and I struggle with balancing multiple fields (So, if I choose another thing, I should give up Android). By the way, I also know Dart, Python, and Java (alongside Kotlin).\n\nI’d really appreciate your guidance!",
  "If you are an Indie dev i really recommend going native and not cross-platofrm. I went cross-platform and fighting both the app store and the play store as a single person quickly get overwhelming. If you are solo stick to one platform at a time.",
  "As a native Android developer with about 10 yeras of experience, I suggest every beginner after learning core concepts of Android development, strat learning KMP/CMP and then lerning core concepts of iOS development. \nMost companies are migrating from native Android apps to KMP/CMP becasue of its growth and similarities with native Android development, like the company I'm working at.",
  "As a new developer, thank you for the guidance.",
  "how many time taking learning kotlin native android dev. as a beginner  ???",
  "14 minutes of no bs only truth",
  "I'd love to hear your thoughts on React Native and why you don't think it's a great choice",
  "Because official frameworks are in market right now for the same job, Like Flutter (Backed by Google), KMP (Supported by Android itself), if there's Collab between native android and native ios in future, which are the only platforms for mobile, ios will handshake with kotlin/kmp whatever because of the similarity they share. React N feels very indirect and too far from the core or official techno for mobile development",
  "Moral is that \"Go and just do that what u like\""
