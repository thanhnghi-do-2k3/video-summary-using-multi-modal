  "Thank you! I learned a lot on this course! I watched the videos, sometimes there's a bit of comedy and sometimes you make typo errors, which makes it a fun experience and a feeling that I do also commit this funny mistakes. I've watched till the end, and again thank you!",
  "01:38:25 hey, can this setting be saved, i mean the last theme the user had chosen? how can i do that?",
  "1:25:00",
  "i needed 44:00 to remind me of how to start a plain material app",
  "Start Date: 8 April, 2025. 4:02 pm",
  "Letsgoooo!!!",
  "Thank you very much, best of luck.",
  "You got this!",
  "I tried flutter. After building the app, i tried launching it on my mobile, but it was very slow. But when i built it in release mode, i was PLEASED by the performance. Nice framework",
  "yeah there is a couple of things that slow down an app with flutter. but overall its pretty cool to build ios and android at the same time!",
  "Half way through, done some programming as part of my degree a long time ago with PHP. Forgot most of it, this has been a great introduction on how to build with Flutter and Dart. I had started with Fluttflow UI app but watching this has given me a much better understanding on what is going on inside that, will be invaluable. I can see me moving into building the app this way going forward once I finish the rest! Lot to take in but very well done.",
  "thank you! yeah personnaly i prefer coding like this, flutterflow is limited at some point, but its still pretty cool. In a future, hopefully, ai will code everything for us, like we give an image and its done. We are pretty close, but not yet there. you got this man!",
