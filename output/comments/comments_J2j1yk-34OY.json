  "Better off learning Android dev and kotlin multiplatform",
  "Christ, here we go. And why exactly is that? KMP is barely out of beta and is considerably harder for the average developer who just wants a simple mobile app. KMP requires you to have at minimum a functional understanding of the Android ecosystem and how Android approaches app development. As well as a reasonably good understanding Kotlin. Further to this, you'll also need to know SwiftUI for Apple devices since Compose Multi Platform is still in beta.\n\nReact Native, although far from perfect, is more than enough for 95% of people's use cases and for those who just want to use their current (web) knowledge to build a CRUD app that isn't a PWA. Expo also provides lots of nice packages for interacting with native features that just make it considerably easier for the average developer. It has been and continues to be used in production at massive corporations.\n\nNative development is pointless these days, unless you have a very specific need that cannot be provided by RN/Flutter or you have a team/a few other developers who can support both Android and iOS asynchronously. KMP is great, but it's far from mature and is much more complicated than using RN/Flutter, especially for the web folks.",
