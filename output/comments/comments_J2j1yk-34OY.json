  "The appwrite link you provided does give us $50 free credits but puts us on a $15 pro plan and forces us to provide a credit card and says the following - You'll pay $0.00 now. Once your credits run out, you'll be charged $15.00 every 30 days. Also once we provide our credit card information it says - By providing your card information, you allow Appwrite to charge your card for future payments in accordance with their terms. Does this mean its $15 a month for this pro plan, the first 3 months are free i.e. $15 X 3 = $45 becaues of the free credits, and, after our credits run out after 3-4 months it will start charging our card?  Update:-- I changed my plan from Pro to Free and now its completely free",
