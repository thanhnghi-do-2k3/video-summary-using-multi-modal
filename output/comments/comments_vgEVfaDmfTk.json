  "I got so many calls from startups asking me if i know back end as well as front end. When i told them that i know only backend then they said i should have learned at least some basics of front end like html, css & javascript. They didn't take my interview because they needed full stack developer. So, I lost few opportunities because i wasn't a full stack developer.",
  "what would you suggest a data science student ,if they want to deploy their Ml models using django or flask but what about front end?",
  "Great advice! Thanks 🙏🏻",
  "Whats the difference from full stack web developer and e-commerce web design? Should I learn e-commerce web design instead ?",
  "Your chasing views because you CANNOT concentrate due to your limited IQ.",
  "That's not true. I've been a developer for 10 years and had lots of colleagues who knew absolutely NOTHING about FE, they did BE only",
  "Government worker in Montana and they are hiring Fullstack as a full position.",
  "Why don't i get hired for frontend for one company and back end for another company 😂😭😭😭 why being a full stack developer 😭😭",
  "I waste too much time to full stack developer, then i meet a senior front developer, he told me that first become a frontend developer, and get a job, after working 3-4 years then become a backen ddeveloper.He told me that most companies appriciate this that this peorson we hired as frontend developer and he is also fullfill the need of backend developer.",
  "thank you mark",
  "I live in Afghanistan can i get a job if i learn front end",
  "oh thank you so much for making this brief video it's so helping since i'm at my 1st yr as CS student<333",
  "in his course he is only teaching front end tools, he is mainly promoting his course and giving bad advise to people who have 0 knowledge on how things work!",
  "What i already learned full-stack?",
  "As a full stack who recently landed a job with no prior experience after learning for 4 months, this video is really helpful for beginners. Even if you don't like frontend, learn it anyway. At first it doesn't feel like you're doing something meaningful but it will come with time",
  "so the front end still has java, what specific languages for front end please anyone?",
  "Html css js frontend backend Java js python c# c++ php",
  "My recommendation if you like backend more:\nLearn simple frontend. I'm only capable of building a frontend with HTML, CSS (and Bootstrap CSS, i love it) and JavaScript and also Blade Templates (comes with Laravel). That's enough to build personal projects. In a team when you get a job there are frontend devs to build the frontend and you'll build the backend.",
  "I want to work for myself thats why am gonna learn full stack",
  "Its good to start with one language and when became profesional than you can became fullstack. Junior fullstack not exists."
