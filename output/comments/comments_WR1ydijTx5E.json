  "Hey guys, I’ve been getting a lot of the same questions/comments so I thought I’d knock them out here.\n\n1. “Over a decade working in tech”. I did sales and marketing for a couple of tech companies before learning how to code. I lumped those years into the “decade of experience” comment that I mention at the end of the video. \n\n2. I got my dev job in 2018. Sure the job market is definitely more competitive, however, employers are ALWAYS on the lookout for strong, up-and-coming talent especially if the potential candidate has the right mindset, intangible values, and are offering to work for cheap (or for free like I did). \n\n3. You can do this internationally! I’ve been a digital nomad since 2013, I’ve met many self-taught devs from Poland, Colombia, Thailand, Philippines and many more countries that all worked remotely (some even for US-based companies). \n\n4. AI is making good devs better. Instead of being afraid of it you should embrace it and use it actively to enhance your learning. Use it to build your next portfolio project so you can tell your employer that you have personal experience using it to work 2-3x faster. Leverage the tech instead of being discouraged by its advancements. There’s still a long way to go before it can talk to clients/users, spec out a feature and solve real business problems on its own. Good devs = good communicators. \n\n5. If you don’t have the means to quit your job, study part-time! I’m the type of person that likes to go all in on things so I saved up some money by working my ass off (even borrowed some) to be able to study full-time. I took a bet on myself and used it as additional pressure to get what I wanted. \n \n6. The interview process for the job I landed went something like this:\n   - Preliminary video interview: I took this chance to open up the code of all my projects and I spoke in-depth about the tools I used, design choices I made, what I learned, and how I built them. \n   - Take home tests: They were CodePen links with instructions. I solved them all but I went above and beyond by explaining alternative solutions (in an email) and explaining why I chose the route I took. Another was a simple CRUD app I had to build and submit on Github.\n   - 2nd Interview: I explained in detail about how I solved the take home tests, asked questions about how they were relevant to the job and even talked about what I would’ve done differently. \n  - Final interview: Culture fit interview: I met members of the management, told my story, showcased what I learned in the short amount of time I had and why. \n  - A week later I received the job offer! \n  - NOTE: I did not have any whiteboard interviews BUT (JIC) in anticipation for one, I worked extensively with my tutor on solving data structure and algorithm problems in preparation for the job hunt. \n\n7. I am NOT offering any 1-on-1 mentorship at this time. I am focused on scaling this YouTube channel but if things change or I develop any further learning products the first update will go to those subscribed to my email newsletter: ➡ https://www.timkim.me/\n\nI used to knock on 200-300 doors everyday, 6-days a week as a door-to-door salesman so if I can do it, I promise, with the right determination, you can too! \n\nThe feedback on this video has been amazing , if you have any other questions feel free to ask them. \nI’ll answer them here or eventually make a follow up video replying to them. \n\nWe spent a lot of time making this video so it’s been awesome to see the positive feedback! \n\nMuch love, \n\n  Tim Kim",

  " @onifadeololade7551  Check the description. I added some courses!",
  "Hi Tim, loved the video, you have no idea how much your story inspired me! \nI'm currently finishing my bachelors degree in architecture and I've come to the realization that this career isn´t really for me. So I was trying to find a new career path when I found Software Engineering and data science, so I'm trying my best to make it happen. You mentioned in your comment that you're a digital nomad and that you can do it internationally. I think that is really cool and would love to do that eventually. I wanted to ask you however, how does it work? Do you work for companies based on your homecontry that are remote and you just travel while doing it? or are you appliyng to foreign country's companies? if so, how do you get paid? (if you don't mind me asking), do you set up and account in some international institution, do you get benefits?. I've seen a lot of software developers talking about this lifestyle but no one talks about this kind of stuff. Sorry if it´s a little intrusive, would love to hear your answer.\nEither way loved the video, keep doing a great job.",
  " @noeliaorbe6775  Great question! \n\nI got lucky as I got a job from my home country (US) that let me work remotely. \n\nI personally wouldn't recommend working directly for international companies (if you're from the US) as the pay discrepancy is crazy (usually).\nSince I worked for a US-based company I got paid normally direct-deposit to my bank account.\n\nThat being said, I know plenty of developers who primary do contract work and get paid per job.\nThey prefer the flexibility.\n\nThanks for the comment.",
  " @TimKimMe  Hi Tim. A lot of other people have said that practicing LeetCode problems are necessary to nail the technical interview. I'd like to ask if you think the same too?",
  "Great video, very helpful. If I may ask, which university did you drop out of and what were your high school grades (average)/qualifications prior to enrolling?",
  " @pennyhardaway7491  I dropped out a small community college because I didn't get into any of the Universities I wanted to and I had TERRIBLE grades in HS.",
  "Hi Tim, can I ask what you think about leetcode?",
  "“Over a decade working in tech”, cleared up with your comment. Still I wonder; you seem at most 22 years of age. What is your age?",
  "@TimKimMe Hey, I just wanted to thank you so much for this invaluable strategies that you shared for job hunting, I want to ask you are a US citizen, I want to get insight to the data that you shared. And I'm really surprised that I couldn't find any public email of yours, not sure why is that but I support that. I wanted to thank you in detail there and ask these questions anyway"
