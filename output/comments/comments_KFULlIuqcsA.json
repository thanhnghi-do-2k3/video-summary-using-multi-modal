  "native still wins",
  "E o NET Maui?",
  "Maui continua a ser odiado e talvez nunca será considerado um concorrente a altura de react native/lynx, kmp e flutter em relação a desenvolvimento de aplicativos para celular",
  "Pra quem quer ser um dev mobile, qual melhor linguagem pra aprender ainda mais pra quem é iniciante. Kotlin ou react native sendo que nao sei javascript.",
  "This is some of the best coding advice for any developer learning to code and trying to determine where to focus their time and energy. The video isn’t about which programming framework is superior but rather about becoming a better programmer, regardless of the framework—especially when a language is no longer supported. From your vlog setup to your color grading, everything was amazing. If there were ever a time to choose a mentor, that time would be now. Thank you for this well-crafted video—you are truly a blessing!",
  "I'm glad to say I liked this video much better than the average Ruby review. Well earned 3 thumbs up.",
  "Thank you! What do you think about Kotlin Multiplatform?",
  "I liked xamarin. It had a design view in visual studio. Now MAUI is on without any designer. (So is asp net webforms vs asp net mvc). Screw Microsoft!",
  "What are your takes on Kotlin Multiplatform? Hearing a lot on this these days.",
  "I would have to look into it. That said, I am sure it is viable, technically, but probably a very niche application ... if you will.",
  "I honestly and truly HATE yutube autodubbing. PLEASE disable it!",
  "Same bro",
  "Native iOS or Flutter ??",
  "Try Delphi 12... Same codebase multiple platforms, native code, no runtimes or interpreters....",
  "Don't forget Unity. I got my 4 player Mahjong PC game running on Android easily. Just changed to URP render pipeline and adding touch controls.",
  "Which I’m curious, I recently had some leads for mobile app and I understand the purpose of the MVP is to get something to market faster and cheaper, but how do you know what features to include in the MVP (outside of regular login functionality) and what not to include in the MVP?",
  "I understand for an MVP is better to use cross-platform but if I had to start and wanted to get into mobile app development (I’m a web developer currently, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) would you recommend to learn Swift and Kotlin first before learning React Native?",
  "Hey bro can u help me out regarding web-dev i am in intermidate phase",
  " @KashmirTechUniverse2432  what do you want to know?",
  "I will tell u everything just drop ur LinkedIn or any other ID where I can share my confusions."
