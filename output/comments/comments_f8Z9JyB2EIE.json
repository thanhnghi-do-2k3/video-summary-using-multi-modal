  "React Native is great but i wish if you create a full stack app using Jetpack compose or Kotlin it would be great and ik it takes alot of time but it would be awesome",
  "well done sir. you did a great job but i couldn't find the link to the git as you mentioned sir",
  "Excellent video!\n\nBut I'm not getting the correct movie count when I'm searching. In my appwrite database it's not working",
  "before you said it i was thinking the same way to implement the saved functionality, create another attribute on appwrite that is boolean (false by default) and then add an image on the movieCard when it's clicked will make it boolean and save the id of the movie, and then get a flat list on the saved component that displays all the movies that have true by calling their id",
  "figma?",
  "in the lost lands 😊😊",
  "where can i find the github repo for this ???",
  "Hello 👋 \nPlease can I get the link to rhe figma and the repo e.t.c\nThe link on the description is not working",
  "I've been working with ReactJS and Next.js (but not React Native); I just started this course yesterday and I'm pretty much enjoying it.\nKuddos, Adrian for putting this together.",
  "don't underestimate flutter",
  "site to download all the assets is not opening",
  "the tutorial is outdated, now I've to upload my personal information to tmdbs to use their APIs, which I don't want to share, and I don't have an application URL to enter, either",
  "What personal information? I just have an email and password created with TMDB. The tutorial is not outdated if the issue is a refusal to use the TMDB API. That's a you issue, not a tutorial issue. I'm following just fine and have been using the TMDB API without any problems.",
  " @timreed9722  and you are following fine doesn't mean others are following fine, tired of this \"working fine on my computer\" nonsense",
  " @Evanupup  What application url are you looking for? The TMDB API key?",
  "Thanks Adrian , plz continue with React Native videos ❤",
  "feels illegal to watch this for free",
  "A year and a half ago I got my first role as a React Native developer. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart because your tutorials have been a wonderful asset in my learning journey and your Job search app was the mobile app in the portfolio that landed me this job. I wish you the best with your channel. Kevin, a years long subscriber of yours.",
  "Wow, it's insane, Kevin! \nWhat else you used as recourses to learn React Native? I found myself boring at web-dev and looking to mob-dev now.\nThanks"
