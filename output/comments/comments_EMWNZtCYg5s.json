  "I wish I would've found this video earlier. I just want a understanding of python, I have already enrolled in coursera for it. I'm 56, a total noobie, and I want to install python on my windows laptop but, I find it very difficult to do so. My main objective is to grasp a understanding of python so I can start to use low code automation for my own business. I'm thinking that I may have bitten off more than I can chew because I can't get python installed, and this is just the beginning of the course. I don't care about finding work in this development field, this will be strictly for self use. Is that doable?",
  "1:27",
  "This is the ultimate hook up",
  "How can I keep being active on my developer journey?\n\nIs there a place where I can constantly get tasks to do and keep my activity alive on GitHub?",
  "and DAMN \"your tweets\"",
  "you're dork!",
  "2. Cheating on the hard work is like wanting to read a long book but not loving to read and not loving to be alone to read it and not loving to invest time and effort to get all you can from the reading.  We live in 2025 but still you must read and make an effort to learn!  It is like want to lose weight by just watching on tv or the internet people jogging!",
  "I had a Java course many years ago and I recently picked it up again using youtube tutorials, chatgpt and sources like stackoverflow. Honestly learned more in less time on my own than from that course back then. And Chatgpt makes mistakes sometimes that even a noob like me can point out. That said, it's been great at explaining some concepts, giving me examples and letting me test code snippets. I'm sure I shouldn't rely on only that, but my point is I don't see it fully taking the need for coding away.\n\nAnd even if it did, well, what I'm coding right now are programs for myself that I want to make. Probably the best way to learn is to be enthusiastic about it. There's never no point to doing something, if you enjoy doing it (well ok, almost never). I'm definitely enjoying it a heck of a lot more now that I can see my own ideas come to life and am making progress, than I was back in the day with that random course.\n\nI definitely doubt there will be no more need for programmers in the near future though. They have to rectify the mistakes of AI, test things, improve things and language models and other forms of \"AI\" don't appear out of nowhere. There's people behind those things.\n\nEDIT: its great that you said you still have to code a lot yourself despite AI being able to help you, so that you can learn it. A friend told me to just let AI do most of it. But as I'm still learning, I even re-write code between different programs so that I can see if I remember how it's done. Good to know the effort I'm putting into it is definitely not wasted. I think I've been coding again since the end of the summer of 2024? Maybe a bit before that? And I'm definitely still not sick of it. No, I have a different pitfall. I want to do and learn too many things at once. I keep starting a program and then getting all these ideas about how to improve it, or ideas for new programs. And when I work on another one I may go back to an old one and re-write the whole thing with new knowledge I've gained.\n\nIt's fun though. But I'm not sure if I would like it as much if I wasn't coding my own projects. I wonder if I would 'survive' a job where I have to code what people tell me to, even if I get good at it eventually. It's a good and important question to ask myself.",
  "Been at it for quite a while, lemme tell you - AI basically makes good coders lazy, and bad coders dangerous. There is going to be a shit ton of horrible software that will need to be fixed by experienced people.",
  "Ai is garbage cause you can't control it",
  "So if I just want a career not a lifestyle I should just give up before I start? Like I want to do my work and go home and not think about it until I get back to work tommorow.",
  "If you know how to code, plan the prompts out, add massive error checking and generate a per module test suite it can be hands off, but you'd better be excellent at debugging and feeding it back through the ai and refining the prompt, still takes work, its like training a cat",
  "What do you think of learning multiple programming languages simultaneously?",
  "Thanks man! loved this video gave me brief idea about the whole coding market thanks man superb video ..this would help me lot in the future.",
  "What I hate about coding, apart from being absolute crap with remembering syntax, is that I only want to perform a handful of tasks but I need to learn 3 months of the language before I know whether or not it's the right language to code in.    In other words, I don't know code well enough to know which code works well enough.",
  "proabably one of the best carrers advice videos on the web! weather intentional or not you nailed the exact recipe for success also if you replace the word developer with anything plumber, librarian, developer and take the same approach it still works and will a huge increase to the odds of success. well done man!",
  "I mean there certainly isnt a shortage of people who should never have pretended to learn to code to do that anymore.",
  "YOU ARE SO CORRECT. i CODE 14 HOURS A DAY AND i LOVE IT"
