  "Hey all! It seems that react-pro-sidebar got updated recently so at 5:41 instead of installing \"react-pro-sidebar\" please install \"react-pro-sidebar@0.7.1\" or else it'll break!\n\nQuestions and Discussions about this project can be asked here in discord: https://discord.gg/2FfPeEk2mX",
  "pin this comment so it's at the top; had to scroll down a while to see it. Thanks for the video.",
  "Awesome!",
  "Hi Ed, in your VS COde I saw your colored colums which indicate the hierarchy of the parent / child elements. Can you name the extension= I wanst able to find any similar. \n\nVery much appreiciated ðŸ’«",
  "I'm a front-end dev and this p*sses me off so much... Dependencies are the weakest link of the chain. If you want to stick to a particular version, it could (and most likely will) get deprecated or breaks later on after big changes in React core, etc. If you keep up with all the newest versions, you'll inevitably run into problems when 2 or more dependencies refuse to cooperate together (styled-components and Storybook, I'm looking at you!)... But I guess that's what's keeping us on our toes, isn't it xD",
  "Â @gambarÂ  I wouldn't say pissed off. But they are way way too many dependencies. While it's nice that some libraries make it easier to get things out quickly, it should not take away from developers' understanding and knowing how to code. If a dev is depending on such libraries then I would question that person as a dev. Not to mention the learning curve for each of these libraries. This WILL break in the future.",
  "â€‹Â @anthonyzornigÂ   is \"indent-rainbow\".",
  "Â @jayvee5886Â  Agreed. If you built a huge project with hundreds of dependencies, do dread the future...",
  "Â @alansenderovich642Â  thanks ! Thats a great one. Cheers",
  "I keep getting all kind of errors ðŸ«  when trying to install all those things under npm ðŸ˜‘",
  "WHAT IS THIS HA.???",
  "Out of interest, why not use MUI drawer component instead of react-pro-sidebar, since we already using MUI?",
  "Â @anthonyzornigÂ  Prettier",
  "thank",
  "hi can you please help me . I'm unable to move forward from here. From Morning I am following your tutorial please help me i cannot restart project again with other tutorial",
  "I am new to react, I should have check out the comments, before wasting a day. Thanks for the instructions.",
  "Â @Xarnage_ENTÂ  try installing them one after the other,it works for me",
  "I'm getting an error here, it says \"Failed to resolve import \"react-pro-sidebar/dist/css/style.css\" from \"src/scenes/global/Sidebar.jsx\". Does the file exist?\". how to fix this problem?",
  "Â @RRCaddickÂ  good question. I am going to use this because react-pro-sidebar gives me some errors",
  "Â @arianitonline8748Â  It should be `import \"react-pro-sidebar/dist/css/styles.css\"` styles.css not style.css"
