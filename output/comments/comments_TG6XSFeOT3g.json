  "hi dylan, thank you for this honest video, what about odin project ? is it good as freecodecamp ?",
  "2025 here, I can feel your honesty. Thanks",
  "Originality pays!!",
  "I've never seen this guy before but I like his non-bullshit aura. Subscribed.",
  "just google it",
  "Could you please explain ‚Äúbuild it again in a framework‚Äù? Do you mean in the same language on a server or ...?",
  "I have been getting advertised a lot of these cites that i think want to hack my brain but now that i know theres a free start then all i can say is thank you üòÇ in case i dont like it then i dont have to pay $7k on learning basic coding",
  "love the 0 bs style, great info here.\n\ncurrently im making a daily practice notepad, as im a trombonist trying to push myself from good to great, its a tool im incredibly happy im building, so far its done great.",
  "1:18",

  "There is a big difference between programming and front end Web development... Taking the CS50 course for front end web dev doesn't make any sense, but it does for an actual software programmer and backend dev because you have to deal with a lot more complex logical problems.. Please stop calling front end Web dev programming for the love of all that is holy",
  "What if I want to purchase a domain with no experience but feel the domain is a future asset how do I keep it safe and basic",
  "I want to learn it know who is ready never late",
  "I agree with you, except for the CS50x. This is by far the best course to understand computers, the best foundation out there to understand how computers ‚Äòthink‚Äô, work and how they are programmed. Not recommending this course across the board is not good. Even if you don't do the exercises, you can still watch all the videos, they are very well structured, instructive and very well presented.",
  "Could you please share any JavaScript course links :)",
  "the odino project and freecodecamp also let you learn javascript",
  "#DataDiggerDon says... Excellent informative video, no BULL, just the truth.  Thanks."
