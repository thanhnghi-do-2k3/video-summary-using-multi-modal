  "About VanillaJS, it’s true that this route does have you building reusable blocks, but to call that „building your own shitty framework“ is misleading. If anything, it tends to be a library of functions. The big difference (aside from the canonical definition- you call me/I call you) is that you hardly ever bother to do declarative binding but either use templating or imperative DOM manipulation. It turns out that declarative binding, the basis of almost all major frameworks, is deceptively tricky and in no framework does it „just work“ in all cases. In fact understanding when and why it doesn’t work is what chases people back to VanillaJS.",
  "you got me laughing so hard at ''last thing the world needs is another javascript framework\" 😂😂 1:15",
  "whichever one my employer tells me to use",
  "Great video! I really appreciate how you broke down the process of building a to-do app with different JavaScript frameworks, starting from Vanilla JS and moving on to React. Your explanation of the trade-offs between each framework and the importance of choosing the right one for a project was extremely helpful. The way you demonstrated the differences in code structure and organization between Vanilla JS and React was also very insightful. Your teaching style is clear, concise, and engaging, making complex concepts easy to understand. I'm looking forward to watching more of your videos and learning from your expertise!",

  "It's cool how the newer Vue 3 with the composition API looks a lot like Svelte. Very easy to read and work on. I recommend it",
  "Thanks",
  "I dont get the hate angular gets...like it has such a great structure with seperate templates and perfect balance of html and scripting....yeah the extra steps of importing module is bit painful but i still prefer angular if i have to create something like ecommerce app",
  "React is the best tbh",
  "All of these and my job has a Java framework for server side rendering😭",
  "I guess its time to provide a sequel of this video",
  "Theres a bug in your vanilla if you refresh more than once, you call the function addTodo on all of the session storage on page load, which duplicates the session storage",
  "Vue is my absolute favorite. Having everything relevant in the same file is honestly so organized.",
  "2025 I like vue js",
  "Mine is VUE. It is most compatible  framework for medium size web application with good backend and cloud integration.",
  "Nah I am gonna build my own 🗿",
  "That‘s why I never do frontends in browsers. I will always stay to backend or command line clients.",
  "You guys are too good with these videos, wtf"
