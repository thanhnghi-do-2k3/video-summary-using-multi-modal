  "niceeee, my question answered on this episode",
  "@zdienos Great to hear.",
  "Excellent. It was fascinating seeing how you implemented your Page Length Selector. It'll be interesting to see what datatable feature you pick next (column sort perhaps). I'm waiting for you to tackle inline editing and saving the results via InertiaJS but there are few other features to go before that. Oh, and please try and do a simple blog project before tackling a massive e-commerce project. Anyone could actually use a blog for learning but only a few people need to deploy an e-commerce solution.",
  "@MarkcRentaNet Thanks for your detailed feedback - I'll keep all of these in mind and I'm looking forward to tackling inline editing as well.",
  "Sir, please create a complete project using the Laravel React Starter Kit, similar to an e-commerce application. It should include relationships and also implement the Spatie Roles and Permissions package using the React Starter Kit\n\n:face-red-heart-shape::face-red-heart-shape:",
  "@MuhammadAliHamzaRizvi  I’m already working on a series that covers a real-world e-commerce project using Laravel 12, React, Inertia, and the Spatie Permissions package! Keep an eye out for the upcoming updates.",
  "@ thank you sir ❤"
