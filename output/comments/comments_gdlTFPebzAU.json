  "Storybook renders a mini page for each registered component. You can have a sub page for each option as well (e.g. one page for a labeled TextField, and another page without the label). This is useful when developing the component to see it in use without needing auth and routing etc. It also serves as interactive documentation for components.",

  "Liked the way you explained in summary.",
  "If it wasn't for 100 second videos by Jeff, I'd be spending at least a few hours of research to get an idea of what it is. Thank you Jeff, you're doing God's work for all of us developers!",
  "Good luck upgrading this piece of shit :) it will be fun",
  "Very good. I aced at storybook by only watching this video.😎😎",
  "Tremendous. I always pause videos and make them 10x as long taking notes and thinking, so I really appreciate the 1-2 minute videos that only make it 10-20 for me.",
  "Thanks for explain it so quickly!",
  "i'm pretty sure you are the only reason I keep learning to code",
  "Great videos, I understand storybook from this video much easier than its own official docs.",
  "What was the tool used to show the component tree?",
  "Instead of just writing the components and get the job done now we have more jobs to do wasting time on an another extra layer..",
  "It's great idea"
